# HW 3

Here's how to run my code:

1. Untar my file: `tar -xzvf u0669715_hw3.tar.gz`
2. `cd hw3`
3. `ant`
4. The jar file will be in the `target/` directory.

Feel free to use my ruby script `test.rb` to compare output. It may not actually be very helpful for you.
It made my job of finishing this assignment a whole lot easier though.

All of the traces that you wish to see are included in the `traces/` directory.

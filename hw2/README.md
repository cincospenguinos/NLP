# Viterbi Algorithm

This program is written in Java 8, and uses Ant to build it. Simply extract this entire directory
wherever you want, and run the command `ant jar` to generate the jar file. Then execute
`java -jar jar_file/ProgrammingHW2.jar <probabilities file> <sentences file>` to run my code.
